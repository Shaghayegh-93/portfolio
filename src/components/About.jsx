              I'm an IT graduate always eager to learn and improve my skills in
              front-end web development methods. In the recent few years, I've
              done my best to learn different languages and frameworks like
              JavaScript, React.js, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS.
              <br />I have a good experience in working with Libraries, getting
              data from APIs, and code based on websitesâ€™ design on Figma.
              <br /> I have worked on many projects using React.js and Next.js,
              and I know how to create effective, concise code while being able
              to keep up with tight deadlines and be adaptive with my responses
              to bugs and issues that arose.
              <br /> Now, I see myself ready to climb up another step in my
              career ladder. I do believe that I would be a passionate,
              hardworking team player who always loves to challenge herself to
              progress more and more.
